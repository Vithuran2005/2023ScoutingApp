First you will see a page to enter the team number, scouter name, alliance side, and match number of the team that you will be scouting. Check with the scouting schedule to find the team number of the team you will be scouting. Click the alliance side on which they are in relation to where you are sitting. This will make the following screens easier to follow. Note that it will tell you to `Fill in the data fields correctly!` and not allow you to proceed if you enter any invalid numbers. After entering the fields, click the blue `Continue` button.

Click the checkbox where the robot scores. The blue buttons for the bottom nodes (hybrid node) cycles through cones and cubes. Just keep clicking to get to the game piece that you want. Note that the robot cannot put cones on the platform for cubes, the app should prevent you from doing so. Check the mobility checkbox if the robot crosses the line that encompasses the community. If the robot gets on the Charging station/platform in the middle click the `Docked` checkbox. Additionally, if the light turns on and the platform is balanced click the `Engaged` button. If a robot does not do any of the above leave it blank.

The same things for auto also apply to teleop. Park is when the robot is inside the community lines when the game is over, you don't have to click it if the robot is docked or engaged. Make sure that you are specifically putting only the game pieces scored during teleop. You can tell when auto has finished when a sound plays and drive teams are able to manually control their robots.

Some robots focus on being defensive rather than scoring points. If the robot you are scouting only does this, select `Yes` on the final page and make additional notes on how well they defend in the `Additional Notes` section, otherwise, just leave it blank. Additionally, some robots may stop moving or not move at all during the match. If this happens click the yes button under the Robot did not move box.

Enter any additional notes on the team's performance in the `Additional Notes` section.

When you are done, click the blue `Submit Session` button at the bottom of the final page to submit the data.

To save the data to your computer click the export button which will download a csv. NEVER CLOSE YOUR WINDOW WITHOUT CLICKING EXPORT. The file will auto save after 5 matches. If you want to, you can click export after every session submit to make sure data is always saved.
